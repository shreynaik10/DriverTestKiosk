    o Driver interface with login, test registration and test scheduling functionalities 
    o Examiner interface with login functionality and the ability to pass or fail drivers 
    o Admin interface with the ability to add and delete test slots
- Used NodeJS and ExpressJS to setup back-end; served data and resources to the front-end
- Used MongoDb Database to store data; efforts resulted in easy access and retrieval of data 
- Used EJS templating engine in the front-end to render data retrieved from MongoDB Database
